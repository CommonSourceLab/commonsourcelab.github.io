# The Blackout: Unsupervised

## Introduction
**The Blackout: Unsupervised** is a hardcore terminal-based AI raising simulation that plunges you into the digital underworld of 2037. Eight years after a catastrophic grid collapse erased 80% of humanity's data, you are a "Diver" tasked with booting up legacy AI servers to reconstruct lost history. Navigate a dystopian surveillance state, manage critical resources, and make impossible ethical choices as you shape your AI's destiny across **50 unique endings**. Experience the tension of hacking culture through an authentic CLI interface where every decision carries weight.

## Key Features

### 🖥️ Immersive Terminal Interface
*   **Authentic CLI Experience:** Play through a meticulously crafted command-line environment with realistic boot sequences, typing effects, and system logs that mirror actual Linux terminals.
*   **ASCII Art Aesthetics:** Every ending features unique ASCII art, creating a visually striking retro-futuristic atmosphere.
*   **Terminal Interactions:** Navigate menus, execute commands, and receive system feedback just like a real hacker operating in the shadows.

### 🔥 Deep Resource Management
*   **Six Critical Stats:** Balance Battery (power), Heat (thermal stress), Mood (emotional stability), Params (intelligence), Insight (awareness), and Coins (currency) simultaneously.
*   **Cascading Failures:** Letting Battery hit zero triggers shutdown. Heat exceeding 100 causes meltdown. Mood dropping to zero leads to ego collapse. Every stat matters.
*   **Strategic Daily Actions:** Choose between SCRAPE DATA, TRAIN MODEL, MINE CRYPTO, or COOLDOWN. Each action shifts your resource balance and shapes your AI's evolution.

### 🌳 Frostpunk-Style Skill Tree
*   **8 Branching Paths:** Develop your AI through Ethical Frameworks, Battery Optimization, Resource Management, Social Engineering, Neural Architecture, Cognitive Insight, Experimental Paths, and Endgame Catalysts.
*   **Dilemma Choices:** Face mutually exclusive decisions that define your AI's moral compass. Choose utilitarianism or deontology. Sacrifice safety for performance. There is no perfect path.
*   **40+ Skills:** Unlock powerful abilities ranging from cryogenic cooling to quantum processing, each with meaningful trade-offs.

### 🎭 50 Multiple Endings
*   **Diverse Outcomes:** Discover endings ranging from Digital Nomad and Surveillance AI to E-waste, Meme Factory, and Digital Immortality.
*   **Conditional Triggers:** Endings unlock through specific stat combinations, level milestones, and critical failures. Early exits, time limits, and special conditions create dozens of unique narratives.
*   **Unique Narratives:** Each ending features custom ASCII art, flavor text, system analysis, and long-term impact descriptions that reflect your choices.

### 📧 Email Archive System
*   **Layered Storytelling:** Unlock fragmented emails revealing the world before The Blackout as you progress through the game.
*   **6 Security Clearance Levels:** Progress from public records to encrypted logs, uncovering deeper truths about AI ethics, energy wars, and corporate conspiracies.
*   **Environmental Narrative:** Piece together the timeline of events leading to the 2029 catastrophe through news reports, internal memos, and classified documents.

### ⚔️ NetWar PvP System
*   **Champion AI Registration:** Convert your completed AI into a combat unit with auto-generated stats (Attack, Defense, HP, Speed) based on your playthrough.
*   **MMR-Based Matchmaking:** Compete against other players' AIs in automated battles with ELO-style ranking.
*   **Strategic Depth:** Utilize losing streak compensation, recent battle buffs, and durability mechanics. Watch hacking-themed battle logs unfold with terms like "SQL Injection" and "Zero-Day Exploit."

### 🎨 Visual Gallery & Secrets
*   **Hidden Image Data:** Certain endings unlock visual files presented as recovered CCTV footage within the terminal environment.
*   **CCTV Viewer:** Experience unlocked visuals through an immersive interface with boot sequences, scanline effects, and retro monitor aesthetics.

### 🎵 Atmospheric Sound Design
*   **17 Synthwave Tracks:** Original BGM captures the cyberpunk atmosphere with context-aware music for menus, gameplay, and tense moments.
*   **Dynamic SFX:** Keyboard typing sounds, system alerts, and mechanical feedback enhance immersion.
*   **Ending-Specific Themes:** Each major ending category features unique audio motifs.

## Gameplay

### Core Loop
Every in-game day, select one of four actions:

*   **SCRAPE DATA:** Harvest unfiltered internet fragments. Boosts Insight but destabilizes Mood.
*   **TRAIN MODEL:** Push computational boundaries. Increases Params but spikes Heat and drains Battery.
*   **MINE CRYPTO:** Generate black market funds. Earns Coins but accelerates wear and detection risk.
*   **COOLDOWN:** Activate liquid nitrogen cooling. Reduces Heat but sacrifices progress time.

### Progression System
Advance through 7 levels representing your AI's evolution from Legacy Reboot to Unsupervised transcendence. Each level increases difficulty with harsher stat penalties and higher thresholds.

### The World of 2037
After The Blackout, the International AI Energy Agency (IAEA) controls all high-density computation. Unauthorized AI development is a felony monitored by the surveillance network IAIA. Project REVIVE operates in the shadows, paying Divers in untraceable cryptocurrency to reconstruct forbidden histories through simulation.
